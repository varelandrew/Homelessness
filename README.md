# Homelessness

## Description
- The purpose of the project is to identify market factors that have estabished effects on homelessness, and construct and evaluate empirical models of community-level homelessness. I will be using Python and Colab to perform operations that help me towards answering the above objectives. This includes cleaning up the original data sets, analyzing the data, and using topics like regularization techniques for multiple linear regression and using tree-based methods and XGBoost.
